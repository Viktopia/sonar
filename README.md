# Sonar - BLE Device Counter

A FastAPI-based service for counting and analyzing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices in proximity. This service provides detailed statistics about nearby BLE devices, including manufacturer identification and device type classification.

## üìã Features

- Real-time BLE device scanning and counting
- Manufacturer identification using Nordic Semiconductor's database
- iOS device detection
- Time-series data collection and analysis
- Historical data persistence
- RESTful API endpoints for data access
- Docker support with persistent storage

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- BlueZ (Linux Bluetooth stack)
- Bluetooth hardware with BLE support
- Proper permissions to access Bluetooth (usually requires root or special capabilities)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viktopia/sonar.git
cd sonar
```

2. **Choose your installation method:**

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Local Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. **Verify Installation:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

> **Note:** This project is primarily designed to run on a Raspberry Pi but works on any BlueZ-compatible Linux device with proper Bluetooth permissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the development server:**

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Running Tests

                "Nordic Semiconductor ASA": 3.0
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### GET /health

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "message": "System requirements met"
}
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Bluetooth hardware access
- Linux host system (for Bluetooth support)

### Running with Docker Compose

1. **Start the service:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Access the API:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Data Management

#### Backup

```bash
docker run --rm -v ble_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar czf /backup/ble_data_backup.tar.gz /data
```

#### Restore

```bash
docker run --rm -v ble_data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar xzf /backup/ble_data_backup.tar.gz -C /
```

## üìä Data Persistence

The service automatically:

- Saves scan history to disk every hour
- Loads historical data on startup
- Maintains data across container restarts
- Stores data in a Docker volume for persistence
